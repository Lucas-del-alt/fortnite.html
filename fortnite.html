 <h1> Fortnite </h1>
 
 <p> This is a first-person shooter that unlike other games, blew up within weeks of release. Its new aspect of building mechanics for either protection from heavy fire or obtaining the highrgound on your opponent attracted loads of attention. The game also is aesthetically and visually appealing, containing a colourful screen. Also, the fact that this game is free attracted a handful of new gamers worldwide.  </p>
